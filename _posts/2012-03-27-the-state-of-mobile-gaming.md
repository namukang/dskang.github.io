title: The State of Mobile Gaming
---

I love the games on the App Store. They're addicting, cheap, and keep
me sane on long train rides. As I continually find and install new
games, one thing has struck me: these games are incredibly simple.

As someone who used to spend hours playing flash games, I'm used to
the short nature of these kinds of games and the instant gratification
that they bring. They're usually centered around high scores (Fruit
Ninja, Temple Run), advancing through various levels (Angry Birds),
and traditional games with the magic social sauce mixed in (Draw
Something, Zynga games).

But there's a whole other class of games that's currently being
completely neglected. I think most of us can remember hunching over
our Gameboys trying to level up our Charmanders (all of you who chose
Bulbasaur can suck it) while trying to avoid all the damn Rattatas
hiding in the grass. I poured hours and hours into that game, avoiding
the wrath of my furious grandma by hiding under the blanket and
stifling my excitement when the screen lit up as my Pokemon evolved.
And for those of you who were more into catching fish and decorating
your homes, I'm sure you remember Animal Crossing. I still have fond
memories of hanging my impressive catches in the museum and paying off
my ever-increasing debt to that crook Tom Nook. I even miss that
stupid mole that showed up to yell at you every time you quit your
game without saving.

As great as the single player gameplay was for these games, there was
nothing like playing with friends. Pitting your beloved team of
Pokemon against your friends' was probably more stressful than is
healthy for a growing kid. And in Animal Crossing, I loved having
people visit my town and then returning the visits to see how they
decorated their towns. What good was planting all those flowers and
fruit trees if you couldn't even show it off? The social aspect took
these games to a whole new level.

Smartphones have made everyone and their grandmother into a casual
gamer, and I'm honestly disappointed that companies like Nintendo have
not taken advantage of that. Imagine playing Pokemon or Animal
Crossing on a smartphone with the social aspects baked in and fully
integrated with the game. In Pokemon, you would be able to trade your
Pokemon with whomever you wanted and go on co-op adventures with
friends. In Animal Crossing, you could live with your friends in a
virtual home and work on paying off your rent together. These are just
simple ideas for games that already exist; I can only imagine what
innovative concepts developers can cook up. The possibilities are
endless.
