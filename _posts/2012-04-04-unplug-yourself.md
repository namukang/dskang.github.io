title: Unplug Yourself
---

Programmers know the feeling of being in the zone, when we're
extremely focused and just churning out quality code. The unfortunate
reality is that it only takes the smallest interruption to break us
out of that zone, and yet most of us don't actively try to suppress
the avenues through which we may be interrupted. If you eliminate
those avenues, I promise you that you'll accomplish a lot more than
you usually do. Go ahead, give it a try. For the next couple of hours,
put your iPhone in airplane mode, disable your Gmail and Google Voice
extensions, and put yourself in a place where there isn't a lot of
foot traffic or distractions. Goodbye, Facebook and Twitter
notifications. The only way someone should be able to reach you is by
physically tapping you on the shoulder.

You might not have the luxury of being able to do this. Maybe you need
to be on call in case your server decides to give you a hard time. In
that case, you can still take some major steps to minimize the number
of distractions you have when you need to get work done. Surely, your
boss won't be trying to reach you for something important through
Facebook or Twitter. Turn off those push notifications. A way that
many programmers unplug themselves without doing so explicitly is by
working into the wee hours of the night. As everyone around them goes
to sleep, there are naturally fewer things to distract them. Why
shouldn't you simulate that environment in the daytime to maximize
your productivity? Unplugging yourself can be a bit scary at first,
especially if you're always checking your email in case the next one
is about how that the uncle you never knew you had left you a couple
million dollars. If you're anything like me, this exercise will show
you that you're actually constantly in a state of distraction,
compulsively pulling out your phone at the slightest buzz. When you
don't let other people dictate where your focus lies, you'll be
surprised by how much you can get done.
