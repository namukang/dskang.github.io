title: Simplicity is King
---

I like making things. If I have a problem that I want to fix or just
have an interesting idea, I'll try to build an application. So far,
I've created the following:

* WikiLink ([Source](https://github.com/dskang/wikilink)) - a Python
  script that provides a fun way to explore Wikipedia by selecting
  several random links from the current article

* [TigerTalk](http://tigertalk.me) - a Node.js chat application for
  Princeton students to talk to each other

* [Web Timer](http://goo.gl/uH4WX)
  ([Source](https://github.com/dskang/webtimer)) - a Chrome extension
  that keeps track of how you spend your time online

  /></a>

* TigerPass (Under development) - a Ruby on Rails application that
  keeps Princeton students informed about the social scene and lets
  them see where their friends are going out to party

  width="580px" /></a>

Out of all of the above, I spent the most time building TigerTalk.
Despite not having a lot of users, I poured hours into making new
features and putting in additional functionality like the ability for
users to create new rooms and having a dinging noise play whenever a
message is received. Why? I thought that the next little feature would
somehow convince people to start using the application and that
TigerTalk would finally catch on. Boy, was that a dumb idea.

Web Timer, on the other hand, has fared a lot better with a user base
of a couple thousand. I use it myself, and it solves a very real
problem that I have of losing track of how I spend time online. Now I
can see that I use 11.4% of my time on the Web to go on Facebook for
an average of 40 minutes and 23 seconds every day. Neat.

I am now a firm believer in building an MVP and showing it to users
before devoting hours into a project that might completely go to
waste. Sure, you'll get some experience out of building a system with
a ton of features, but you could have spent that time building
something that people will actually use. It turns out that keeping
your applications simple have a two-fold benefit: it lays naked the
core idea behind your application so you can easily tell whether it
resonates with users or not, and it allows you to avoid sinking too
much time into a project that will never take off. It's important to
know how to work hard and battle through hard times, but it's just as
important to know when to quit if something just isn't working. As
long as you keep it simple, you're bound to eventually succeed.
